### Windows: Dealing with Python

* Download Python from windows store (recommended, because of PythonInterpreter location and Pythons installation path read by CMD) - or download Python 3 from official Python homepage : [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) <br/>
* Go to CMD (windows key + R - then type CMD) and type: `python`
* If python recognized by OS: type `exit()`
* in CMD (The Black box in your PC) type: `pip`
* if no error: type: `pip list`
* if no error: type `cd` or `exit()`
* if no error: type: `pip install telethon`
* if this is not working try: `pip install Telethon` with big "T"
* type `cd`
* type `dir`
* type `cd` + *the directory where you unpacked this script*
* go to the directory. *Example*: cd C:\User\username\somefiles\somenonsensefolder\finallysomething\THE_ACTUAL_PLACE_YOU_STORED_THIS_AMAZING_PARDON_SCRIPT
* ok, now we start this with: `python telegramskript.py`

### Tip:
After extracting data from Chats create a New_Folder on your PC, encrypt it (RECOMMENDED!!) and save files with a new unique & descriptive name. <br/>
Every time this script runs it will replace the current .json files in the Folder where you store this script!!!!! This is because the code is not complete!!!!! <br/>
**PLEASE SAVE EXTRACTED DATA IN NEW FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPT AGAIN ON NEW TARGETS!!!!**

### Dealing with Telegram
Some tips and ideas before connecting to Telegrams' Servers;

* If possible: buy a second SIM-Card (Prepaid) from a cheap provider to create a new Telegram account: Telegram is very strict with banning script-bots, therefore, in case you are using your "main" Telegram account with your private number it is recommended from my side to create a second account just for the script testing etc.
* Try to NOT use a VPN when logging in with your PC, the probability is very high that Telegram will ban you after your first login and API request.
* In case you get banned: Try to log in with your phone, there will pop up a message on your phone: banned from Telegram. If this happens, just click on the `help` button and send the Telegram support an E-Mail. *Note: DO NOT change the auto-generated Text inside the E-Mail!! just send the autmated support-request text and notify Telegram that you have been banned. Most times, if that is your first ban, Telegram will unban you after some time. In my case it was approx. 30minutes*. <br/> For more information about this click here: [Telethon-Library-Bans](https://github.com/lonamiwebs/telethon/issues/824#issuecomment-432182634)
* Do not use VPN for the first time connecting to Telegrams servers, this got me banned immediately.
* Also: Download Telegram for your desktop and log-in on your computer. Use your Telegram account on your phone to authorize the desktop app.
* Chat the Telegram Spambot @Spambot first to check if your account is compliant with Telegrams spam-guidelines and policies, if there if no "Spam-Issue" you can continue.
